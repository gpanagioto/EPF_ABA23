Electricity Price Forecasting

This repository contains the final project for the Advanced Business Analytics course at DTU, focused on electricity price forecasting. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model to forecast electricity prices, leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques.

Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to create an accurate and robust forecasting model that can predict electricity prices with a high level of accuracy. The project will involve the following steps:

1.Data Collection: Gathering historical electricity price data from reliable sources.
2.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a thorough analysis of the data to gain insights and identify patterns.
4.Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features or creating new features to improve the predictive power of the model.
5.Model Selection: Evaluating and selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task.
6.Model Training: Training the selected models using historical data and optimizing hyperparameters.
7.Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
8.Model Interpretation: Interpreting the results of the models and understanding their predictive power.
9.Model Deployment: Deploying the final forecasting model for real-time predictions.
